Today I'm the Operations Manager in the manufacturing line at fORd 🚗, where every car:

Goes through painting 🎨,
Then assembly 🔩,
And finally, quality control ✅.
In the exact same order for every car.

Each car goes through multiple machines, but in the exact same order, and delays in one step can lead to bottlenecks ⚠️.

Different types of cars ⏱️ require different processing times, even though they follow the same sequence.

🎯 The goal? Minimize the total time required to complete all jobs.

Optionally, you can explore other objectives like minimizing idle time for machines 💤 or balancing workloads across machines ⚖️.

Solving this problem:

Saves time 🕑
Increases throughput 📈
Reduces machine downtime 🛑
Improves customer satisfaction 🙌
Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩

Let’s get these cars rolling smoothly! 🚙
