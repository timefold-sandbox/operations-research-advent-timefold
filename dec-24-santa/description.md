🎅 Santa's coming!

🎄 Santa needs to deliver presents to children all over the world before Christmas morning 🎁.

However, there are some challenges:

Each child has a specific time window when they are available to receive their gift (maybe they're asleep 😴 or out playing 🛝).
Santa's sleighs have a capacity limit 🛷, and given the massive scale of this operation, he must decide how many helpers (sleigh drivers) are needed to complete all the deliveries efficiently.
Here's the catch:

🦌 The reindeers travel at 1000 km/h, and they go in a straight line 🛤️ from one house to another.

🎯 The goal?

Determine how many sleigh drivers Santa needs.
Plan the sequence of deliveries for each driver to ensure every child gets their gift on time! 🕰️
