Our company is launching a new product line! ðŸŽ‰

To ensure we cater to the broadest range of customer preferences, we must select 6 products from a pool of 30 candidates.

ðŸ“Š The chosen products should be as diverse as possible, such that the smallest difference between any two products is maximized.

Considering we know the distances between products...

How can we achieve the most distinct set of products for our launch?

Can you help me solve this problem? ðŸ§©
