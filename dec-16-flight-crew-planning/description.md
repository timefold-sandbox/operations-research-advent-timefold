✈️ Today I'm a crew planner at QatOR Airways 🌍

I'm responsible for ensuring that all flights are adequately staffed 🧑‍✈️👩‍✈️ while minimizing costs.

🎯 My daily goal is to assign crew members to specific tasks while ensuring optimal resource utilization.

🚧 The complexity:

This is no easy task! Compliance with work-hour restrictions, rest requirements, and skill qualifications makes it challenging 😵‍💫.

(But let's skip those details for now! 😉)

📋 What I know:

The cost for operating a flight, along with its start and finish times 🕒
The cost for a crew going from one flight to another one 🚖
Since this is a daily task, I usually have a maximum of 8 minutes ⏱️ to complete it so I can send the crews to other members of my team.

Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩

Let’s optimize the crew schedules and keep the skies running smoothly! 🛫
