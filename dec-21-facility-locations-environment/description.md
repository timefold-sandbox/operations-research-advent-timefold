Today I'm the 🌱 Environmental Risk Management Officer at EnergyOR, a power plant company.

📈 The challenge:

Our company is expanding its operations, and we need to determine the best locations for 25 facilities (e.g., power plants or waste treatment centers).

However, these facilities emit noise 🔊, heat 🌡️, or pollutants 🌫️, so their placement requires careful planning.

🚧 Key considerations:

We must strategically locate these facilities as far as possible from:

🏫 Schools
🏡 Residential areas
🌳 Other sensitive zones
⚠️ The risks of poor facility placement:

Community Resistance: Complaints, protests, and legal actions ⚖️
Environmental Impact: Health risks and reduced quality of life 🌍
Operational Challenges: Costly retrofits or relocations due to public outcry 💸
🗺️ What we know:

A list of sensitive entities affected by power plant placement 🏠🏫
A list of potential facility locations 📍
A distance matrix 📏 among these points
🎯 Our goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum distances between that set of 25 facilities and the entities.

Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩
