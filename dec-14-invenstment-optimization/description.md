Yes, today I'm the CIO of jpmORgan 💳.

As the CIO, and considering we're at the end of the year, I need to prepare the beginning of 2025 in terms of investments 📈📉. My task? Create a diversified portfolio for our clients.

Our goal is to balance return 💰 and risk ⚠️ for the portfolio.

We're considering 31 assets, but will select only 12 of them. Those 12 selected assets will weight 100% of our budget 💵.

Information available:

A mean return (expected performance over time) for each asset.
A standard deviation of return (risk) for each asset.
A correlation coefficient with every other asset.
I've calculated an efficient frontier just in case you need as a reference. This efficient frontier shows trade-offs between risk (variance) and return.

🎯 Objective:

Maximize the Sharpe Ratio 🏅.

Select the specific weight for each asset ⚖️
Consider an annualized risk-free rate of 3% 🌟
The data is monthly, so make sure to adjust it accordingly 🗓️
Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩

Let’s make 2025 a profitable year for our clients! 🤑
