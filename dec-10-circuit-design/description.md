I didn't tell you before, but I work pretty hard at ElectORnics.

We design and produce cutting-edge ðŸ’¾ memory and logic chips.

A chip is full of components like logic gates, flip-flops and registers, functional blocks and input/output ports ðŸ”Œ.

All of them are interconnected inside the chip.

Well, my job consists on improve that interconnection as much as possible to:

ðŸ•’ Reduce signal delay
âš¡ Lower power comsumption
ðŸ“‰ Simplify wiring complexity
This helps extend the life of the chip.

I found a way to do that, though it's pretty hard when doing it by hand ðŸ¤¯.

I place all the components in a linear layout, and I count how many interconnections there exist for each pair of consecutive components ðŸ§®. It's like I draw a vertical line in every pair of consecutive components and I count how many wires cross that line.

Then I get the maximum of those, and I try to minimize that by ðŸ”€ moving components along the linear layout.

When moving them, I need to recalculate some. I find solutions to the problem, but I think there might be a much better way to do it ðŸ¤”.

Can you help me solve this problem? ðŸ§©
