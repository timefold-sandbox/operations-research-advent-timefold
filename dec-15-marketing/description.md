I'm the marketing manager of WalmORt planning an exciting promotion campaign 🛒

I want to maximize the total profit 💰 from a combination of products featured in a special deal.

🛍️ Key details:

Each product has:
🤑 An individual appeal to customers (profit).
🔗 A cross-sell effect when paired with specific other products (synergy).
Each product also has an individual cost 💸.
The total cost of the selected bundle must not exceed a fixed budget 🧾

Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩

Let’s optimize the product selection and make this campaign a blockbuster! 🚀
