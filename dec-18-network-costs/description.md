Hey, MORgan here, a network design consultant for 🌐 VerizOR.

My job is to ensure that we connect 📡 specific key locations (like cities, servers, or data centers) in the most cost-effective way possible.

However, we need to ensure that our connections form a network 🔗, and we want to minimize the total cost of laying cables 🛠️💵.

📋 Here’s what we know:

We have a bunch of nodes interconnected 🖧, and each connection has an associated cost (the expense of laying a cable between two nodes).
Some of the nodes are terminals 🔑, which must be connected together.
We can use other non-terminal vertices as intermediate connection points if necessary.
The goal is to find the minimum-cost subgraph that connects all terminal vertices directly or indirectly while satisfying the network constraint.

Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩

Let’s connect efficiently! 🌟

PS: if costs are close, how will you decide between multiple solutions?
